"""Algorithms for estimating graphical models from marginal-based loss functions.

This module provides a flexible set of optimization algorithms, each sharing the
the same API.  The supported algorithms are:
    1. Mirror Descent [our recommended algorithm]
    2. L-BFGS (using back-belief propagation)
    3. Regularized Dual Averaging
    4. Interior Gradient

Each algorithm can be given an initial set of potentials, or can automatically
intialize the potentials to zero for you.  Any CliqueVector of potentials that
support the cliques of the marginal-based loss function can be used here.

    This optimizer works by calculating the gradients with respect to the

    This is a standard approach for fitting the parameters of a graphical model
    without noise (i.e., when you know the exact marginals).  In this case,
    the loss function with respect to theta is convex, and therefore this approach
    enjoys convergence guarantees.  With generic marginal loss functions that arise
    for instance ith noisy marginals, the loss function is typically convex with
    respect to mu, but not with respect to theta.  Therefore, this optimizer is not
    guaranteed to converge to the global optimum in all cases.  In practice, it
    tends to work well in these settings despite non-convexities.  This approach
